# Aligning with my manager

## For my manager

- What are the things you care most about and are trying to accomplish in your role?
- What are your biggest challenges?
- What are your most urgent priorities?
- How would you describe my role and responsibilities?
- What are your pet peeves that I should avoid?
- Who is someone you had a great working relationship with that reported to you and why did it work so well?
- What is success for your team?

## For me

- What is success for me personally?
- What information do I have that my manager doesnâ€™t yet know?
- What are the constraints I'm operating under?
- What are my current unknowns? How am I planning to get more clarity?
- What constraints do I believe should be challenged?
- How can my manager best support me?

## For me and my manager
- How do we prefer to communicate?
- How can we avoid surprises?
- How do we prefer go receive/give feedback?
