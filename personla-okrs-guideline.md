## Overview

Everyone is responsible for the growth in their career. Having goals and objectives helps the growth of the individual in a way that is aligned with the company's/team's goals and strategy, as well as with the individuals' needs.

Well crafted OKRs are also a key for visibility and helps to better inform individuals' growth and clarify expectations.

## About Goals

We are living and working in a constantly changing environment. We can’t have a control over external influences, new challenges and opportunities, thus the goals are not static, they change over time.

In order to ensure that we are on track with the change, goals need to be reviewed in a regular cadence.

## Objectives guideline

When carving out objectives, it is helpful to think about balancing them within these three categories:

1. Personal ambitions and growth
1.1. Self-reflection is a good input for this
1.2. Using opportunities company provides can drive the objective (e.g. SAT and
L&D)
2. Team and peer needs
2.1. Peer feedback, manager feedback are a good source for this 
3. Job expectations and company goals 
3.1. Career progression frameworks can help to identify areas that can help to improve on)
